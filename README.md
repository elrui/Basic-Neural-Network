# Basic-Neural-Network
A set of basic implementations related to Neural Networks

## Bike Sharing
This project is based on an [academic assignment](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). The original intent of the project is to predict Bike Sharing patterns, using a dataset with data from a 2-year period. However, the real challenge is the implementation from scratch of a basic neural network, which would include:
* Implementing an activation function
* Implementing the forward pass of the network to calculate values
* Implementing Stochastic Gradient Descent / Backpropagation
* Evaluate training vs validation loss and determine whether the model is converging
* Change different hyperparameters and analyze the effect on tge results
